# Exercises

Each subdirectory here contains a SystemVerilog design exercise. Your design should be implemented
in `top.sv`, which includes a description of the module you should implement.
These exercises are intended to familiarize you with basic digital logic design in SystemVerilog
without taking too much time.

Each exercise comes with a testbench that's (mostly) self-checking. To check and see if your
solution was correct, just run "test.sh" in each directory. A pass/fail will be printed on
the screen, and a `dump.vcd` waveform file will be generated so you can debug.
